FreEM norm is a parallel corpus which covers
a range of different genres of text throughout different decades of the 17th century, written in prose or verse, which have been semi-automatically normalised ([Gabay 2019](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02276150)) and manually corrected. Most of these texts are French texts that belong to the _belles-lettres_ (_i.e._ literature in its broadest sense), which is the type of source we want to normalise, but additional texts from different traditions (science, law...) are marginally present in the corpus.

If some of the transcriptions have been produced specifically for this corpus, some others have been borrowed to other projects: transcription rules are therefore not strictly equivalent from one text to another regarding, for instance old characters (_e.g._ the long _s_, _ſ_) or abbreviations (_e.g._ _õ_→_on_). "Normalisation" is understood here as a partial alignement with contemporary French: in some specific cases, specific spelling are maintained to keep intact the meter of the verse (_e.g._ the adverbial _-s_: _jusques_+vowel → _jusques_ and not _jusqu'_ to have three syllables).
